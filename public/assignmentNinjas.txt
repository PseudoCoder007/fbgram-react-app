A1.Correct Output-
What is the correct output of the given code.
var x='6';
try {
    console.log("Before throw statement");
    if(isNaN(x)) throw "is not a number";
    x = Number(x);
    if(x > 5) throw "is too high";
    //If x is not greater than 5, it logs the string "After throw statement" to the console.
    console.log("After throw statement");
  }
  catch(err) {
    console.log("Error caught : " + err);
  }
  finally {
    console.log("I am in finally!");
  }
  Solution-Before throw statement Error caught : is too high I am in finally!

Solution Description
x is a string but it is a Number so, NaN will return false and then x is converted into a number. Since, it is greater than 5 it throws an error “is too high” and the next cole.log statement does not get executed. Error is caught and a message is displayed. Then control goes to the finally keyword and then "I am in finally!" gets printed. 
 
A2.statements are true.
sol-
Async makes sure that a promise is returned and if it is not returned then javascript automatically wraps it in a promise which is resolved with its value.
Await makes the code wait until the promise returns a result. It only makes the async block wait.
Promises can be consumed by registering functions using .then and .catch methods. then() is invoked when a promise is either resolved or rejected.
Hurray! Correct Answer
Solution Description
The await keyword is only valid inside async functions within regular JavaScript code. If you use it outside of an async function's body, you will get a SyntaxError .
